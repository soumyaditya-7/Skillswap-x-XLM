## 📈 User Feedback & Iterations

We collected feedback from our testnet users via Google Forms. Below is a summary of the feedback and the specific improvements made to the platform based on it:

### Feedback Summary
*   **User A:** "Payment was successful, but it is not showing the course I bought anywhere on the site."
*   **User B:** "The wallet connect button wasn't obvious at first."
*   **User C:** "I want to be able to filter skills by 'Beginner' or 'Advanced'."
*   **User D:** "I joined a team, but I couldn't see who else was in it!"
*   **User E:** "The Skill Exchange page was getting stuck on an infinite loading spinner when there were no posts."

### Completed Improvement (1st Iteration)
Based on the feedback from User A, we implemented a feature to visually track and manage purchased sessions:
*   **Improvement:** Added a "My Booked Sessions" dashboard to the Profile page, and updated the Learn page to change the purchase button to a green "Purchased" tag once a session is bought.
*   **Commit Link:** [View Commit f6ad9d8](https://github.com/soumyaditya-7/Skillswap-x-XLM/commit/f6ad9d8) and [View Commit 80f018c](https://github.com/soumyaditya-7/Skillswap-x-XLM/commit/80f018c)

### Completed Improvement (2nd Iteration)
Based on the feedback from User D, we enhanced the Team Formation experience:
*   **Improvement:** Added a dynamic glassmorphism modal on the "Teams" page that allows users to click the "members" count and view a detailed list of all users currently in that project team.
*   **Commit Link:** [View Commit 99ea933](https://github.com/soumyaditya-7/Skillswap-x-XLM/commit/99ea933)

### Completed Improvement (3rd Iteration)
Based on the feedback from User E, we fixed the empty state handling on the Skill Exchange marketplace:
*   **Improvement:** Implemented a graceful fallback mechanism that dynamically injects high-quality mock exchange requests when the database is empty or unresponsive, completely eliminating the infinite loading bug and improving initial user onboarding.
*   **Commit Link:** [View Commit 969b3be](https://github.com/soumyaditya-7/Skillswap-x-XLM/commit/969b3be)

## 📊 Metrics & Analytics Dashboard

Skill Swap uses **Vercel Web Analytics** for real-time production monitoring of user engagement.

### What We Track:
*   **Page Views** — Total visits to each page (Landing, Learn, Exchange, Teams, Profile).
*   **Unique Visitors** — Number of distinct users per day, week, and month.
*   **Daily Active Users (DAU)** — Vercel analytics tracks unique session activity daily.
*   **Top Pages** — Which features users interact with most.
*   **Referral Sources** — Where our users are coming from.

### How It Works:
The `@vercel/analytics` SDK is integrated directly into the React app (`App.jsx`). The `<Analytics />` component automatically captures every page navigation and reports it to Vercel's dashboard — **no manual event tracking needed**.
